ARM Microprocessor (AM) Benchmarks project build instructions:

If building the project outside the ti-sdk environment that contains a rules.make the user must modify the file DIRS

These variables must be defined in the DIRS config file:
DESTDIR ?= < Must point to the install directory of the target file system >

NOTE:When setting paths do not have any leading or trailing spaces in the path i.e. LINUX_DEVKIT_PATH=/home/user/fs/opt/arago-sdk

Below are the command line build options.
To Build: make all

This will build both the debug and release versions of the Matrix TUI project.

To Install: make install

This will install the binaries into DESTDIR defined in the makefile.init.

To clean: make clean

This will remove the objects and executables in the respective Debug and Release directories

To Build Debug only: make debug

To Build Release only: make release

Note the makefiles located in the respective Debug and Release directories are generated using the Eclipse IDE
and should not be modified if the user expects to build from within the Eclipse environment.
