 *  G711 specific extension of XDM's ISPHENC1 interface
 *
 *  This example codec demonstrates how a user can take an existing
 *  algorithm, like SUN's G.711 codec, and implement the ISPHENC1
 *  interface.  Once this interface is implemented, the algorithm can
 *  then integrate into the various XDM-based frameworks and
 *  applications.
